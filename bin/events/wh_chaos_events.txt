# THE DOOM ENGINE

# Those events are responsible for maintaining the balance of forces in

# WH world they compute the doom counter which

# is the number used to describe how bad world is corrupted by chaos (1-100)

# Also those event are used to treat chaos invasions etc

# The Doom Counter increases and decreases, representing the surges of Chaos energy pouring in.

# The Endtimes Counter always slowly increases, with a higher or lower chance depending on the Doom Counter level.

# If it reaches maximum, it is game over.

# Armaggedon counter:

# 1-19 : the forces of order are at peak of their strength

# 20-39 : cultists activity minor beastmen attack

# 40-59 : severe cultists activity, disease, wars etc are spreading

# 60-79 : chaos invasion

# 80-99 : fate of world hangs in the balance, last time it was that bad in time of Anaerion the Defender

# 100 : ultimate destruction - game over

# Due the work of elven vortex which is sucking the chaos energies

# the counter wents down each two months (-2)

# However every bad thing that happen in world increase a counter a little bit

# DOOM COUNTER RAISING
