# OUTLINE OF BASIC WITCH HUNTER VS CULTIST SYSTEM

# Learning determines how good a witch hunter is, they gain learning when they complete a mission

# Intrigue determines how good a hidden cultist is; when it comes to exposure, the result is based on their intrigue vs the witch hunter's learning

# Beware: Paranoid witch hunters will consider even a good explanation proof of guilt as well, as clearly a good cultist would be a good liar!
