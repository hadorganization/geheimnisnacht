ormazdian4desc;After his successful war against [FromFrom.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName] has declared [From.GetReflexivePronoun] Calif-al-Umma - the spiritual leader of all Ormazdics. Only the Kitabids, a sect denying the right of any single [From.GetManWoman] to rule all Ormazdics, stand against [From.GetHerHim]. As a [Root.GetTitle] of Araby, you stand at a crossroads: do you acknowledge [From.GetHerHim] and risk becoming a mere servant, or will you deny [From.GetHerHis] right to rule by joining the Kitabid sect and risk the wrath of [From.GetHerHis] followers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian5desc;[Root.RelHead] has declared himself Calif-al-Umma - spiritual leader of all Ormazdics. Your liege, [From.GetBestName], has chosen to acknowledge [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] authority.

ormazdian3name;Rise of the Ormazdic Califate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian3desc;Since the days of Mulhaed al-Quyat, the Calif-al-Umma has been the spiritual leader of all faithful Ormazdics. The real power of the Calif has waxed and waned over the centuries: at times, he could rightly call himself Sultan of All Araby. At other times, he was but a mere figurehead for a more powerful ruler.\nHowever, the disastrous reign of the last Calif of All Araby, Jaffar, and Bretonnian occupation after the Crusades, shattered the prestige of the Calif and splintered Araby into many princedoms. Since then, no-one has dared call himself Calif. Now, a young preacher has gathered an army of insolent peasants around himself and calls himself Calif. Should his rightful liege be unable to suppress the revolt, Ormazdics everywhere could be lead to acknowledge his authority. As long as there is no rightful Calif, the danger of such an uprising will persist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
