tb_black_crag_desc;Black Crag, or Karak Drazh in Khazalid, is the largest and most well known Greenskin stronghold in the world. When the Dwarfs still held the Black Crag, it provided a strong defensable position in the south of the Worlds Edge mountains, and was also a very rich hold. It would survive the Time of Woes, but would fall shortly after to Greenskins, turning the once great hold into a scar on the Dwarfs honor and history.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_khypris;Khypris;;;;;;;;;x
ca_khypris_desc;Khypris, the city of splendours, is a massive trade city located in the borderlands, once the capital of the grand Khyprote empire in ages past. While the empire is long gone from most human minds, the prestige and power of the city remained, and as such is considered the greatest city between Myrmidens and Akendorf.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_akendorf;Akendorf;;;;;;;;;x
ca_akendorf_desc;Akendorf, once the captial of a long lost Imperial borderlands Elector-County, is the center of all Imperial influence in the borderlands, straddeling the boundry of what the Imperials consider the 'civilized' world, it is a city that is constantly under threat. Not just from the Orks of the badlands, or Goblins from the mountains, but from the inummerable Beastman tribes that inhabit the foreboding Stygian Woods. Due to this, Akendorf is considered the weakest between Khypris and Myrmidens.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_myrmidens;Myrmidens;;;;;;;;;x
ca_myrmidens_desc;Myrmidens is the second largest city-state in the Borderlands, capital of the Aegean Principality, one of the sucessor states of the Myrmidan Empire. The days of Myrmidia's Empire are long gone, but the proud and civic traditions it left behind are still strong, reflected in Myrmidens' strong, yet elegant walls, designed to impress and intimidate would-be conquerors and foreign diplomats. Dealings with Dwarf holds have increased Myrmidens' importance not only as a trading hub, but also as a technological and military center, as both Human and Dwarf work closely with each other to stamp out the Greenskin threat to the south.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_al_haikk;Al-Haikk;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_haikk_desc;Al-Haikk is traditionally the capital of Araby, whenever the nation is united. Once known as the “Jewel of Araby”, the city has declined importance in recent years, with continued wars, disasters and sieges targeting it due its source of legitimacy as the seat of the Great Sultan of All-Araby. While it’s usually called the “City of Thieves” nowadays, due to the rampant depopulation – and thievery – in some of its old quarters, and overshadowed by other thriving rival cities, it remains a prestigious location to all Arabyans.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_arabyan_qassabah_1_desc;The Arabyan Ksar, or "citadel" in the Imperial tongue, is the central administration complex for all Arabyan military settlements. While the Ksar is the military might of the Arabyans, their architecture is legendary, full of impossible shapes, domed-roof buildings, and a myriad of spires, all linked with small walkways to get to-and-from. This not only serves to appease foreign emissaries, but to provide a confusing, maze-like structure, making it difficult for invaders to successfully take an Arabyan settlement.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_tarikahwarriors_1_desc;The Tarikah are lightly armored sword-and-bow infantry units that act as the mainstay for any Arabyan army.

ca_shushtar_1_desc;The Shushtar used to be an ancient Arabyan tribe that used mounted archery and lightning fast cavalry strikes to great effect against the old Nehekharan empire. While their tribe would eventually perish, their fighting style would not, and the Nomadic Nehekkas, Tevari, and the Urban Ramaccans now use it to once again wreak havoc onto their foes.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_shariati_1_desc;The Shariati are the 'heavy' cavalry components of Cophic and nomadic Arabyan armies. Unlike the Shushtar, who use mounted archery and harass tactics, the Shariati make use of the sturdy Arabyan camel to deliver devastating charges unto enemy lines. It is also known that foreign horses(those that are not native to Araby) are afraid of camels due to their smell, and so the camel cavalry was also initially the reason for many Arabyan victories during the crusades.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_ramaccan_jannisaries_1_desc;The Ramaccan Janissary is the penultimate, modern Arabyan warrior. Raised from a young age to be a killing machine, these soldiers are of the highest quality an Arabyan lord can field, and normally serve as his or her bodyguards and elite detachments in the field of battle. Heavily armed, incredibly disciplined, these warriors make short work of anyone foolish enough to stand in their path.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_tevari_sanddevils_1_desc;In the harsh deserts and sand dunes of Araby and Nehekhara, heavy armour and infantry are mostly impractical. Due to this, and the nature of the lifestyle of the Tevari and Nehekkas, most of their number fight on horseback. Lightly armored, these warriors are quick enough to chase down even mounted skirmishers.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_southland_elephant_1_desc;Due to the closeness of the Southlands and Araby, -not just geographically speaking- most, if not all Arabyan cities have city quarters inhabited by Southlanders. While this may seem innocent at first, these quarters more often than not are poorly maintained, and lawless, save for one part, the War-Elephant pens. Great care is taken in maintaining these pens, for should an Elephant get lose in a city, it could be disastrous.;;;;;;;;;x

#Estalia#;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ct_magritta;Magritta;;;;;;;;;x
ct_magritta_desc;Magritta is the largest and probably the most important settlement in Estalia. Located on the southern shore of the peninsula, it’s one of the main trading ports of the Southern Seas. Magritta maintains a strong maritime presence here, and aggressively patrols its waters against Sartosan pirates, Arabyan corsairs and, while at it, imposes a “toll” on foreign ships moving through its territory. It is also the home of the Archecclesiatium, the main temple of the Cult of Myrmidia.;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bilbali;Bilbali;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bilbali_desc;Bilbali is, in many ways, a stark contrast to its southern rival, Magritta. Where Margitta’s climate is warm and bright, Bilbali is always covered in rain and fog. While Magritta’s golden shores are bathed by the temperate waters of the Southern Seas, the waves of the Great Ocean clash against the rocky cliffs of Bilbali. This is noticeable even their produce, as Bilbali’s main export is the weaponry in their military arsenals and gunpowder refineries. It also acts as a trading hub between Lustria and the Old World, and the city is unusually welcoming of Bretonnian merchants ( For an Estalian city, that is ).;;;;;;;;;x
#Tilea#;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_miragliano;Miragliano;;;;;;;;;x
ca_miragliano_desc;One of the mightiest city-states of Tilea, Miragliano is always assailed by the plagues and insidious ratmen coming from the Blighted Marshes to its west. As a result, the city itself is highly fortified, with walls specially designed to give maximum advantage to artillery firing from it, and towers that never crumble even when leaning at near-comical angles. These excellently planned fortifications are the results of the sponsorship of engineering, science and other arts by the Princes of Miragliano. Thus, it is not surprise that this was the city to give birth to the genius inventor and engineer, Leonardo da Miragliano.;;;;;;;;;x
ct_remas;Remas;;;;;;;;;x
ct_remas_desc;Remas is the greatest and most ancient city in Tilea. It is home to a huge circular port, said to have been built when the city was still a High Elf trading post, and even in the ruined and dilapidated state it is now, it still houses the powerful Reman fleet. A great bridge links the city proper to the port, and also houses many businesses and the fine palaces of the merchant princes. Remas proper is laid out on a grand scale within a long circuit of defenses, and protected by mercenary companies of pikemen that fight in the ancient style.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_grandnecropolis_1_desc;Grand Necropoli are what remains of the ancient Nehekharan cities of old. While in their pasts, they may have been luxurious cities of gold and plenty, but now all that remains are hollowed husks of citizens and buildings alike. After the curse of Nagash brought the Tomb Kings back to life, many have tried to return to their old ways, some going so far as to order their servants to gather water from long dried up wells, or to hold feasts full of food and wine that none can taste.;;;;;;;;x

What might have once been a clean, brightly colored and highly decorated wall is now covered in sand and dust, and decayed from the millenia these walls have had to endure. While they may be old, these wall should not be mistaken for being weak and ready to collapse, for much like the pyramids, these cities were built to stand the test of time.;;;;;;;;x

ca_averlander3_1_desc;Long ago, Averland was populated by the Brigundians, masters of cavalry warfare, providing Sigmar with his elite cavalry forces needed to unite the Empire and defend it. While the Brigundians are no more, their traditions remain a proud, dutifuly practiced tradition among the nobility of Averland, producing some of the finest horsemen in all of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirlander_1;Stirlander Free Companies;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirlander_1_desc;Stirland is a county deeply rooted in tradition and superstition, believing completely in the age old saying 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. This is mirrored in their free companies, who are stubborn attackers and defenders in any situation.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_stirlander3_1_desc;Stirland is a poor and barbaric land, unsuitable for farming and trading. So instead, the peasantry take to hunting, and due to Stirland's proximity to Sylvania, these hunters are hardend souls used to seeing monstrous horrors that would make a normal man run for his life, some even actively hunt said beasts.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_talabeclander_1_desc;Talabecland is a realm that is swallowed whole by the Great Forest, the largest of five great forests in the Empire. Like all of the forests, it harbors untold amounts of bandits, Greenskins, Beastmen, and even sometimes Chaos warriors should an invasion fail. Due to this, Talabecland has formed an elite archer unit comprised of the local hunters, tasked with hunting and exterminating any dark threats that lurk in the shadows of the Great Forests of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_talabeclander2_1_desc;While the Empire continues to try and contain the vast forests that grow within it's borders, it is sometimes neglectful of it's roads that criss-cross the entirety of the Empire. Traveling the Empire in good times can take weeks, especially going through Woodland Roads. Due to the sheer amount of danger inhabiting these forests, stopping to rest in the middle of nowhever is impracticle, so the Elector-Counties-Talabecland especially- have established fortified coaching inns along the roads for merchants and travellers to rest in safety.;;;;;;;;;x

While it provides money and supplies to the county, it isn't exactly a safe job, with bandits, Greenskins, and even Beastmen roaming the dark places of the forest, so each lumberjack is skilled in the use of a bow-and-arrow, and can be levied in times of war to support the militia of Talabecland.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_drakwalder_1_desc;Drakwald is a harsh, and unforgiving land, it's people tempered by the forest, and long remember their ancestors, the Thuringians. This life-style is reflected in it's Free Companies, hardy and unshakable.

ca_nordlander_1_desc;The Nordland, much like all counties in the north of the Empire, is a hard land, with the only constants being strife and death. While it does not have to bear the brunt of Chaos incursions, it is constantly pillaged and raided by the Norscans. But not all of them leave, as some settle down in the Nordland, bringing with them their belongings and traditions, of which the Nordland has adopted in the form of it's Warbands and Beserkers. High on some fort of shrooms and bloodlust, Beserkers throw themselves willingly into the frey with little regard for safety, carving bloody swaths into enemy formations.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_nordlander3_1_desc;The Nordland, while sparsly populated, is home to not only Imperials, but Norscans as well that have been permitted to settle in the county. Due to this mix of cultures, Nordland does not field 'militias' but instead raises warbands, semi-professional soldiers that serve terms. Undisciple and barbaric, these soldiers are much more aggressive than their southern counterparts, but can be relied upon to hold a line or crush the enemy lines.;;;;;;;;;x

With Sylvania being a poor and backward county, these free companies are truly a desperate lot, more often not even being able to afford the proper uniform, let alone weapons.

ca_ostermarker2_1_desc;The long history of the Ostermark and the countless invasions from the north it has endured has lead to the development of military tactics that counter the horse-based armies of the Chaos wastes.

With spices and other exotic wares flowing through, and more and more adventurers and misfits arriving in search of adventure, the future of Al-Aliman seems promising and more importantly, profitable.

They wear mostly padded armor, but also wear striking masks to frighten their enemies and bring them luck on the battlefield. Their darts are tipped with poison from the most poisonous plants and frogs in the area, and it is considered a great honor to not only catch the frogs and tip darts in their poison, but also eat them...;;;;;;;;;x

Yet, the Old Ones provided for their children and one of their Spawning Pools gave birth to a wise and powerful Skink Priest who resisted the Jade and freed some of their siblings. Mabuya is the last independent outpost of the Lost Lizardmen, desperately trying to survive the vampiric invasion from the east.;;;;;;;;;x
