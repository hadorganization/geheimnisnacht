ca_slayer_keep;Slayer Keep;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_slayer_keep_desc;Karak Kadrin, otherwise known as "Slayer Keep", is a mighty Dwarf hold that has guarded one of the few major passes through World's Edge Mountains, the peak pass. For countless centuries this hold has guarded the lands of Kislev and the Empire to west against greenskin threats and worse. The hold is home to the Shrine of Grimnir and is a sacred place for all would-be Slayers. The hold also has a long history of Slayer Kings who have passed down their slayer oath through generations.;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
ca_everpeak;Everpeak;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_everpeak_desc;Everpeak, Karaz-a-Karak in the language of the Dwarfs, is the ancient capital of the Dwarf empire, the "Pinnacle of Mountains", the "Most Enduring". It is the oldest and most glorious hold of the mountain folk and inside its halls is the greatest concentration of wealth in the world. Visitors have been awestruck at the magnificent beauty of the place. The most important hold politically and religiously in Dwarf culture, Karaz-a-Karak boasts of the mightiest army, greatest runesmiths and largest population out of all the Dwarf realms. It is from here that the High Kings rule and where the sacred "Great Book of Grudges" and the "Book of Remembering" are kept. It has endured countless ages against all manner of foes but it has never fallen and will endure until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_zhufbar;Zhufbar;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_zhufbar_desc;Zhufbar, known as the "Torrent-gate" in Khazalid, is a Dwarf hold built nestled in a deep chasm under the lake called Black Water. A huge waterfall that falls high above the city provides the necessary power for the numerous Dwarf machines that have been constructed here. The city is the principle shrine for the Engineers Guild and is a center of every kind of industry. It was here that the famed Gromril metal, which was mined from nearby Karak Varn, was smelted and forged into many famous Dwarf artefacts.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_barak_varr;Barak Varr;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_barak_varr_desc;Barak Varr, Khazalid for "Sea Gate", is a unique Dwarf hold in that it is the only Dwarf seaport in the world and houses the whole Dwarf fleet. Located at the easternmost point of the Black Gulf, the hold is built in a vast water filled cavern, carved into a cliffside which provides a natural defence for the harbour. The mighty Ironclad ships of the Dwarfs as well as numerous merchant vessels from all over the world can be found here as well, sailing in and out of the vast cavern. This hold is among the most friendly to non-Dwarfs and in turn has great revenue from trade.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_iron_peak;Iron Peak;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_iron_peak_desc;Known as "Iron Peak", Karak Azul is built with it's upper portion on a plateau overlooking the valley below, which is unusual compared to other holds. It is also the only southern Dwarf hold that has withstood the greenskin invasions over the centuries but at great cost since today Karak Azul's population is very meagre. However, many famous rune armours and weapons were and still are being made in the hold which has contributed to the continued survival of the hold.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_horn_hold;Horn Hold;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_horn_hold_desc;Karak Hirn, or "Horn Hold" in Khazalid, is the largest and wealthiest of the Black Mountain holds. Its name comes from the fact when wind blows in a certain direction, the large cavern within the hold creates a sound reminiscent of a mighty warhorn which is heard for miles around and which the Dwarfs have taken advantage of for many uses.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_copper_mountain;Copper Mountain;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_copper_mountain_desc;Translated as "Copper Mountain" in Khazalid, Karak Izor has the prestige of being the first and largest Dwarf hold outside the World's Edge Mountains. Located in the Vaults, it has access to the richest metal deposits, ranging from iron to copper and tin, outside the World's Edge Mountains and its influence is such that Dwarf settlements from all across the Vaults, and as far as the Apuccini Mountains, look to Karak Izor for protection and guidance. There is also a miniature version of the Underway being built deep beneath the Vaults which would allow unhindered trade between Dwarf settlements in the region.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_karak_norn;Karak Norn;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_karak_norn_desc;Known as "Barren Earth Hold" in Khazalid, Karak Norn is the major hold in the Grey Mountains. Its population consists mainly of displaced clans from fallen holds across the Old World. While not being particularly wealthy because of the Grey Mountains' lack of large mineral deposits, Karak Norn does control the vital mountain passes in the southern Grey Mountains. It is also strategically placed on a high plateau above Loren Forest, to keep a close eye on the Wood Elves because of the long distrust the two races have for each other. Karak Norn is also on good terms with its neighbouring human realms and has helped both the Bretonnians and the Empire in the past.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_white_lions_of_chrace;White Lions of Chrace;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_white_lions_of_chrace_desc; Chrace is considered to be the wildest of the realms of Ulthuan and as such it breeds the toughest and hardiest Elf warriors. The most famous of these are the White Lions of Chrace who have a fearsome reputation that is on par with their namesake, the White Lions, whose pelts they wear as a badge. Armed with large two handed axes, they serve as heavy infantry in Ulthuan's armies and are known to serve the Phoenix Kings as personal bodyguards.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shadowlands;Shadowlands;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_shadowlands_desc;Dark and desolate, the Shadowlands are the shattered remains of the once-mighty Elven kingdom of Nagarythe. Destroyed during the elf civil war known as "The Sundering" a large portion of the population of Nagarythe was killed, and almost all of the survivors migrated to the north west to present day Naggaroth and became Druchii. The few who chose to remain have lived a bleak existence, hell-bent on vengeance against the Druchii. These inhabitants are known as Shadow Warrios and all are trained in the arts of war for they need to be to take the brunt of invading Druchii armies.;;;;;;;;;x
