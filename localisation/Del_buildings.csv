ca_middenheim;Middenheim;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_middenheim_desc;Built upon a five hundred feet pinnacle of rock, Middenheim is the capital of the Imperial province of Middenland and one of the greatest fortress-cities in the realms of man, second only to Altdorf in size and influence. It is also home to the Cult of Ulric whose loyal followers would sacrifice their lives for defence of the city, the most fearsome being the legendary Knights of the White Wolf who would utterly dedicate themselves to the city's defence in a time of need.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_altdorf;Altdorf;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_altdorf_desc; Altdorf is one of the oldest cities in the Empire, one of the and arguably its grandest, dating its foundations back to the time of Sigmar himself. Within the city's Dwarf built walls, establishments like the School of Engineers and the Cult of Sigmar conduct their day to day business protected by one of the most well equipped and trained armies in the Empire. Thanks to the city's vast wealth, it has profited from acting as one of the foremost centres of trade in the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_nuln;Nuln;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_nuln_desc;Nuln is both a spiritual and technological centre for the people of the Empire. Along with Altdorf, Nuln holds the second seat for one of the two Arch-Lectors of the Cult of Sigmar. The technological side to Nuln comes from its long and distinguished trade with the Dwarf holds, under whose expert guidance has allowed the engineers of the city to produce some of the best blackpowder weaponry in the Empire and the finest artillery crews.;;;;;;;;;x,,
ca_marienburg;Marienburg;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_marienburg_desc;The great city of Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in the entire Old World. Its wealth flows in from all corners of the world, no other city houses merchants from Ulthuan next door to those from far off Cathay like Marienburg. Due to this, the city enjoys a rich cultural mix which can be seen even among the local merchants who are renowned for their flamboyant ways.;;;;;;;;;x,,
ca_talabheim;Talabheim;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_talabheim_desc;Located in the centre of a vast crater, Talabheim is the capital of Talabecland and serves to continually watch over the darkness of the Great Forest that covers the region. The city itself struggles to cover much of the crater, allowing farms to exist with its rocky walls which ensure a steady stream of supplies during sieges, only adding to the impregnability of the city. With the rims of the crater fortified and two large fortresses placed at its only entrances, Talabheim is truly a beacon of safety for poor souls travelling along the Old Forest Road and so has allowed the city to function as the main centre of trade in the area.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_drakenhof;Drakenhof Castle;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_drakenhof_desc;Castle Drakenhof is situated on the peak of high clifftop from where it casts it's dark gaze over the blighted lands of Sylvania. The citadel was cursed even before Vlad von Carstein's arrival and made it his home, an event which would further damn Sylvania in the annals of history.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ca_averheim;Averheim;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_averheim_desc; Lying on the banks of the river Aver, the city of Averheim is the capital of the southern region of Averland. At the centre of this prosperous city sits the impressive keep of Averburg where the Elector Count takes up residence, safe in the knowledge that it has never fallen to an invading army. The fertile region of Averland is famed for its cattle and so during the warm summers it is common to see the stockyards surrounding Averheim to be filled with cattle merchants and their livestock, sometimes even crowding the streets within the city itself, a fact which has led to Averlanders and their cattle being the joke of Imperials from other provinces.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hergig;Hergig;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_hergig_desc; Hergig is the heavily defended capital of the sparsely populated province of Hochland. Despite being covered by both the Drakwald Forest and the equally as dangerous Forest of Shadows, Hochland has surprisingly managed to remain resilient against the constant threat of Beastmen, Forest Goblins and other dark horrors lurking in the forests. This is mainly due to its highly skilled state troops who tirelessly patrol the forest. Due to many Hochlanders being trained hunters and marksmen, their state troops contain an abundance of archers and handgunners, the best of which are armed with the highly accurate Hochland long rifle, a weapon that has earned a fearsome reputation among the Empire's foes.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_wolfenburg;Wolfenburg;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_wolfenburg_desc;The people of Ostland can best be described by the provinces symbol of the bull. Stubborn and resolute, Ostlanders are a hardy folk as one would imagine given how close they live to the Chaos realms of the north. Due to this fact of life, Ostlanders are prone to a life of almost constant drinking with some even spending most of their lives intoxicated as a way of boosting their courage to deal with the harsh world around them. The city of Wolfenburg has long been a bulwark against the threats coming from outside the Empire and from within, even if the rest of Ostland has fallen, Wolfenburg will stand strong until the end.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_stirland;Wurtbad;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_stirland_desc;Wurtbad is the capital of Stirland, a rural and poor region in the Empire. Stirland has maintained a reputation amongst other Imperials of being a rural backwater despite the many large towns that dot the countryside. Part of this is due however to the nature of Stirlanders themselves who are for the most part a conservative and superstitious folk who have remained hostile to outsiders, something which becomes understandable given their close proximity to the cursed land of Sylvania. The armies of Stirland represent the poor nature of their region with most state troops not even able to afford a proper green and yellow uniform, carrying a small token of their region instead. It would be a foolish mistake to take this poverty as a sign of weakness as soldiers from Stirland are just as devoted and brave as other Imperial soldiers.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_imperial_gunnery_school_1;Gunnery School;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_imperial_gunnery_school_2;Gunnery School;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_imperial_gunnery_school_3;Gunnery School;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_imperial_gunnery_school_4;Gunnery School;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_imperial_gunnery_school_desc;This school trains the province's state troops in the use of blackpowder weaponry, highly dangerous weapons to both the user and their enemies.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ca_nuln_artillery_foundry;Nuln Artillery Foundry;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_nuln_artillery_foundry_desc;The grand city of Nuln is the centre of production for blackpowder weapons and accessories in the Empire with even many dwarfs taking up residence here to lend a hand in both producing and designing many of these weapons.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
#Wood Elves#,,,,,,
tp_the_forge_of_starlight;The Forge of Starlight;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
tp_the_forge_of_starlight_desc;The Forge is Starlight is the home for craftsmen and artisans alike within Athel Loren. At the heart of this realm lies one of the legendary Anvils of Vaul,whose roaring fires light up the forest every night to forge only the greatest of equipment for Wood Elf kinbands. Vaul's Anvil also acts as a temple to Vaul himself and so it is one of the few locations within Athel Loren where fire is sacred.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
tb_the_oak_of_ages;The Oak of Ages;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
tb_the_oak_of_ages_desc;The Oak of Ages is the beating heart of Athel Loren and the place where the Wood Elf realm was truly established. It is here that Ariel holds her court during the Summer months , disappearing inside the huge tree with Orion's ashes during the Winter, what occurs or even just what lies inside of the tree is unknown to all but Ariel and only a few other rare souls. The Winds of Magic are drawn to the tree and can alter its appearance depending on which wind is blowing strongest at that time, it is often said that a single acorn from the tree will have more magical power than most artifacts crafted by mortal races. Given the immense importance of the Oak of Ages, the Asrai will defend it more heavily than anywhere else in the forest, giving up their lives more than willingly to protect it.;;;;;;;;;x,
tb_wydrioth;Wydrioth;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
tb_wydrioth_desc;The pine crags of Wydrioth are a realm under constant threat of invasion thanks to the dwarfs and Greenskins pouring down from the Grey Mountains. Its steep mountain slopes appear to be no more dangerous than anywhere else in Athel Loren, it is only when the invader moves beneath the eaves of the forest that they come across its true nature. Here the Asrai have shaped a whole fortress out of their sacred forest. Entire strongholds created out of massive oaks and a maze of rockbriar forming tangled and gnarled walls, all linked together by endless treetop walkways and tunnels fashioned out of the tree roots. This living defence has thrown back many a prospective Dwarf and even standing firm against a mighty Waaagh! The elves of this region are even more bloodthirsty and unkind to strangers than their kin, often cutting the attacking forces down to the last snotling.;;;;;;;;;x,
tb_cavaroc;Cavaroc;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
tb_cavaroc_desc;The Elves living in Skymark Reaches in the realm of Cavaroc are famed horsemasters, swift to attack and swift to anger, they will always be at the forefront of Athel Loren's armies when the forest is roused to war. The finest horses in the whole of Athel Loren are raised here thanks to the fact that this realm is one of the few which is sparsely-wooded, covered in rolling grass plains instead.;;;;;;;;;x,
tb_atylwyth;Atylwyth;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
tb_atylwyth_desc;The realm of Atylwyth has been locked in the cold embrace of winter for an eternity, each tree coated in a thick glazing of frost and every glade heavy with deep snow. Only a rare few forest spirits dwell in this icy part of the forest and these few that remain slumber through the ages. As a result of this disconnection from the forest, the elves of Atylwyth are highly militant, boasting one of the largest and most well trained force of Eternal Guard in the whole of Athel Loren for they are the only force willing to protect this part of the great forest.;;;;;;;;;x,
tb_yn_edryl_koiran;The Kings Glade;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
tb_yn_edryl_koiran_desc;Yn Edryl Koiran, otherwise known as the King's Glade, is an immense and awe-inspiring clearing at the heart of Athel Loren in the realm of Talsyn. Ever since the Elves first entered Athel Loren this glade has been the centre of their civilisation, holding council here even before Ariel and Orion arrived. Over the centuries Spellweavers have crafted a great city in the ancient oaks that surround the glade, buildings and chambers made out of the living trees everywhere from their roots to the tree branches. To the unawary visitor, the city is invisible thanks to most of the inhabitants living either beneath the ground or above their heads as well as the centuries of magic woven into the area. The King's Glade is also where Ariel and Orion rule with the aid of their council made up of fifteen lord and ladies from the forest realm, an extraordinarily prestigious post for any Asrai to hold.;;;;;;;;;x
#Bretonnia#,,,,,,
ca_couronne;Couronne;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_couronne_desc;The traditional capital of Bretonnia, Couronne is a large sprawling city heavily protected by a formidable series of bastions and towers spread out over the high walls. At the centre of the city lies the king's palace, a large citadel which allows the monarch to observe the lowly peasants beneath them from a safe distance. The city of Couronne also stands out for being one of the few clean cities in Bretonnia, something it owes to the great temple of Shallya and to the natural springs which can be found throughout the city.It is commonly said that the people of Couronne are born in the saddle, an exaggeration but one that holds some element of truth as the Couronnians are famed throughout the land as experts on equine matters. Other Bretonnians would call them obsessed with horses but even they cannot question the fine skill of Couronnian horsemen.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_languille;L'Anguille;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_languille_desc;First established by the High Elves as a trading port, the city of L'Anguille is truly one of the wonders of the Old World and still one of the main trading ports. The most obvious landmark in the city is that of the three-hundred feet tall lighthouse and the high walls that extend from it to surround the city. Both walls and lighthouse were constructed by the Elves and so bear the familiar signs of their fine craftsmanship which stands in stark contrast to the more recent and human built buildings within the walls. The oldest of the buildings inside the walls is castle itself which is located on a small island in the middle of the harbour, commanding the entire bay with its impressive defences.;;;;;;;;;x,,
ca_brionne;Brionne;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_brionne_desc;Much like the other cities in the dukedom, Brionne is a city based around beauty rather than practicality. Nevertheless, the castle at the heart of the city remains a surprisingly well-defended fortress despite its beautiful exterior. The entire city is set upon a hilly peninsula that is only joint to the mainland through a narrow and easily defended neck, the land around forming a natural harbour. Due to the regions strategic position, the Dukes of Brionne are tasked with maintaining a fleet of warships to patrol the southern coast from whomever would disturb the realm.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lyonesse;Castle Lyonesse;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_lyonesse_desc;Castle Lyonesse is located on the north-west coast of Bretonnia, built upon a large island just off the mainland. As a result of this naturally defensive position, the castle is heavily fortified both by its natural defenses and those established by the Duke such as the huge keep at the peak of the island. At the high tide it is possible for small boats to sail right up into the outer courtyards whilst at low tide the sea sweeps back revealing ruins on the sea bed, thus any invading army must time their attack to avoid being stuck in either the high or low tides.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_montfort;Montfort;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_montfort_desc;The castle and town of Montfort are located on the Bretonnian side of the Axe Bite Pass, a crucial defensive location against both greenskins attacking from the grey mountains as well as the Empire, a realm with whom Bretonnia has been at war with just as much as they have allied with. Due to this strategic location, Montfort Castle is one of the best human constructed fortification in the Old World. Spreading out from the massive keep are five tiers of giant sixty feet walls which have been firmly constructed into the rock itself, protecting the large town of Montfort from any hostile invaders. Naturally the Bretonnians here have decided that their hard work has earned them the right to exact heavy tolls on merchants or any other traveller that braves the dangerous but utterly important pass. Ironically and in a true Bretonnian fashion, this also includes the towns own citizens who pay much in order to gain access to the inner sections of Montfort.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_parravon;Parravon;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_parravon_desc;The impressive Bretonnian city of Parravon has been carved directly into the living rock from an outcrop of the Grey Mountains. Castle Parravon dominates the stunning city below from its high vantage point at the peak of the outcrop, tunnels stretching far down into the heart of the mountain further increasing its defensive capabilities. Parravon is also famous for its Pegasus Knights as the noble creatures themselves can be found in the nearby section of the Grey Mountains more so than anywhere else in Bretonnia.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ca_artois;Artois;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_artois_desc;Built in the midst of the beastmen infested Forest of Arden, Castle Artois is a well-fortified keep that has withstood its share of battles. The castle's real focus however is around providing safe accommodation for the Duke and his many mounted warriors, yeoman and knights alike, who ride out on endless hunts against the beastmen of the forest.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_bordeleaux;Bordeleaux;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_bordeleaux_desc;The bustling port of Bordeleaux holds much in common with many of the other major ports in Bretonnia being built off of ancient Elven ruins from the time long ago where they lorded over this land. The mighty castle of the Duke rests atop a cliff that rises over the main harbour, the countless siege weapons on its walls being able to reach any point in the city and the bay. Over the years, Bordeleaux has found itself in an ongoing commercial rivalry between itself and the great northern port of L'Anguille, a rivalry that Bordeleaux has always been on the losing end of.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_gisoreux;Gisoreux;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_gisoreux_desc;The city of Gisoreux is a bustling city filled with merchants and travellers from all across the Old World with it even being said that there are more Imperial traders in Gisoreux than any other city in Bretonnia. The massive bulk of Castle Gisoreux dominates the entire city, a single curtain wall runs for well over a mile long, enclosing two large keeps that provide accommodation and protection for many of the local dignitaries.;;;;;;;;;x,,
#Tomb Kings#,,, ,,,
ca_the_black_tower;The Black Tower of Arkhan;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_the_black_tower_desc;The Black Tower is the home of the legendary Arkhan the Black, first and foremost of all Nagash's followers. This dark tower was built by Arkhan at the height of Nagash's reign of terror and so the lands around it are saturated with dark magic, further protecting it from whomever may be foolish enough to intrude. From this tower Arkhan furthers his knowledge of dark magic,constantly seeking to improve his skill with the final goal of eventually being able to revive his dark master, Nagash.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_necropolis_of_khemri;Khemri;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_necropolis_of_khemri_desc;The once great city of Khemri retains little of its former glory, the soaring towers of shining gold and the grand pyramids made of limestone and alabaster are likened to the Tomb Kings themselves,  completely rotten and fully decayed with age. The largest of the pyramids still dominate over the rest of the city thanks to the undying efforts of the Liche Priests tasked with slowly restoring the cities monuments. Nevertheless, Khemri still remains the centre of the ancient empire of Nehekhara and those who hold it even in its current state are seen as truly great leaders.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_lybaras;Tomb City of Lybaras;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_lybaras_desc;No different to the other cities in Nehekhara,the Tomb-City of Lybaras is an image of decayed splendour. This once glorious city is the resting place of the beautiful but formidable Queen Khalida who has dedicated the entire city to Asaph, the Nehekharan goddess of vengeance and magic who endlessly promises Khalida revenge on Nagash's vampiric spawn. The city itself is difficult for invading armies to approach, protected from the west by mountains, east by the dangerous waters of the Gulf of Fear and south by the Cursed Jungle. These natural defences have allowed Lybaras to strongly resist Khemri throughout its history.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_zandri;Zandri;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_zandri_desc;The ancient city of Zandri was one of the first cities built in Nehekhara with many even claiming it to be the very first major settlement. In these times of old Zandri was the centre of a vast naval empire, fleets with ships numbering in their hundreds were stationed here and untold riches constantly flowed through the city. Although these times have long since passed, Zandri has remained an important port-city in Nehekhara and a key location that any King of Khemri would wish to control.;;;;;;;;;x,,
#Kislev#,, ,,,,
ca_kislev;Kislev;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_kislev_desc;The large and well developed city of Kislev is home to the Tzars of Kislev who rule over their empire from the Palace Gospodarin located in the heart of this grand city. As with the entire Empire of Kislev, the city remains under constant threat from Norscans and Chaos forces lurking to the north. Despite this constant menace, the city of Kislev has never fallen to an invading army yet, standing strong against countless sieges while the surrounding countryside burns. The Ungol and Gospodarian people who live here are a hardy folk, their horsemanship and combat skills forever tempered by raids coming down from the north which has enabled the Tzars to field one of the most fearsome mounted armies in the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x
