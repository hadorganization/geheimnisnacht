VeryWeakDoom;The word from the priests are clear. At the moment, the Winds of Chaos are very weak, but they may grow stronger as war, sickness, and conflict continues to rage in the mortal world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WeakDoom;The omens of doom have been increasing slightly later. While not yet at apocalyptic levels, the Winds of Chaos seem to be growing - though for now, they are still weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ModerateDoom;The priesthood is divided, but their auguries indicate that the Winds of Chaos have reached levels where it is much easier for daemons to enter the world. They are still only moderately strong from a historical perspective, but this could easily change in the near future if current trends continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
StrongDoom;Strange storms afflict the world, and they are sometimes accompanied by the laugher of daemons. Other chaotic phenomena have been increasing as well. The signs are clear - the Winds of Chaos are strong at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VeryStrongDoom;Dark lightning clouds of unnatural colour constantly hover over the northern horizon, and the winds often carry the laughter and cries of daemons. Dark dreams trouble your citizens, and the many priests are saying the End Times are near. The Winds of Chaos have reached truly dangerous levels of strength indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
