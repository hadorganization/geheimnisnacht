EVTDESCsblooddragons30;The stench of rotten meat is not hard to catch in the fresh air of the night. It quickly leads your company to a small, hidden valley where a group of bloated ogres are consuming a screaming meal of captured humans. The creatures are well distracted by their horrific activity and could fall easily into an ambush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30;Nonsense, we attack directly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsblooddragons30;An ambush, to punish stupidity with death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsblooddragons30;This is beneath us. We'll ride by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons30001;[From.GetFirstName] has led you to a group of feasting ogres. The creatures are too busy taking bites off screaming humans to care about what's happening around them, therefore [From.GetFirstName] has decided to sound the horns before issuing the charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30001;Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsblooddragons30001;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons30002;The ogres were startled by the warhorns and are stumbling to their feet, gathering their weapons to prepare themselves for the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30002;We shall fly and strike from above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDsblooddragons30002;Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons30003;Along with [From.GetTitledFirstName] you fly up on your steed, diving down towards the valley where the ogres clumsily try to prepare themselves for the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBsblooddragons30003;While [From.GetTitledFirstName] flies up with some other knights to strike the ogres from above, you charge in with the remaining vampires, clashing against the first of the lumbering brutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30003;Raahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons30004;You rise up with your fellow knights on nightmares and quickly dive down upon the ogres. The hulking bruisers come forward, waving their clubs, trying to strike you down, but you dodge their initial attacks and plunge your lance into one of the bigger brutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30004;You've feasted on your last meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons30009;You follow [From.GetTitledFirstName], charging in on your steed and ready yourself for a brutal impact against the bloated mass of flesh that is your first opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30009;I'll pierce right through you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons30010;You ride before your knights, charging in on your steed and ready yourself for the brutal impact against the bloated mass of flesh that is your first opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30010;I'll pierce right through you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons30011;The foolish creatures might have had easy game on the mortals they were eating, but your knights made short work of their lives. Their brutish strength was of no avail against your discipline and ruthlessness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30011;Let's move, their entrails stink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons30012;The ogres joined the battle with great ferocity and determination and what could have been an easy ambush turned into a tight battle. You swing too close to one of the bruisers and your sword remains stuck in the creature's belly. Before you can dislodge it, the ogre dismounts you from your steed with a blow from his enormous fist and bites your head off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30012;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons30013;The foolish creatures might have had easy game on the mortals they were eating, but you and the other knights made short work of their lives. Their brutish strength was of no benefit to them against your discipline and ruthlessness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30013;Their stench is unbearable up close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons30101;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to surround and ambush the foolish creatures as they eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30101;I can help with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsblooddragons30101;Trickery is not my skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons30102;After dispatching your knights to silently surround the valley, after giving the signal and charge, you strike down the first ogre from afar with your lance and charge in with the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30102;Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons30103;The ogres were caught completely off-guard by your ambush. Only a couple of the biggest bruisers managed to survive the first volley of spears, but by the time they reached for their clubs and maces, your knights were already upon them, ready to strike them down with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30103;An easy victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons30104;The ogres were caught completely off-guard by your ambush. Yet, as your knights join the fray, it appears clear you underestimated your foe. The brutes turtle up, taking in your strikes and at the first opportunity charge out, trampling you along a couple of other knights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30104;Arghhh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons30105;The ogres were caught completely off-guard by the ambush. Only a couple of the biggest bruisers managed to survive the first volley of spears, but by the time they reached for their clubs and maces, you were already upon them with the other knights, ready to strike them down with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons30105;Pitiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons31;You had a bad feeling about the forest, but you needed shelter from the sun and only caught the scent of Chaos once inside it. As your steeds grow restless, you finally spot the first Bestigors emerging from the morning mist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons31;Charge forward! Cut them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsblooddragons31;Fall back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons31001;You were looking for refuge from the morning sun in a misty forest, but your leader soon realizes there's something wrong. A herd of beastmen emerges from the shadowy trees and rushes towards you. [From.GetTitledFirstName] calls for an attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons31001;We can fight those things back with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsblooddragons31001;*Fall back*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons31002;You charge along with your knights, swinging your sword to behead foul beastmen left and right, but more and more pour in from the mist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons31002;You senseless beasts! Die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons31003;You were looking for haven from the morning sun in a misty forest, but your leader soon realizes there's something wrong. A herd of beastmen emerges from the shadowy trees and rushes towards you. [From.GetTitledFirstName] calls for a temporary retreat to regroup and fight further back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons31003;Sounds sensible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsblooddragons31003;I won't risk my life with such a plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsblooddragons31004;You fall back for a mile or so, taking advantage of your horses' speed to make the creatures of Chaos lose their momentum, then turn around to face them and charge. The Gors on the frontline, emboldened by your retreat, are caught off-guard as you turn about and face them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons31004;Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons31005;Their numbers and the favourable terrain might have allowed the beastmen to corner you initially, but they were deadly wrong in thinking such trickery could have gotten the better of you. When the ground is soaked with their foul blood, the remaining Gors finally retreat, howling in terror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons31005;Run, you degenerate scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons31006;For every dozen beastmen you and your knights mow down, another dozen appears from the wild, charging in to face you. A minotaur manages to finally ram you and toss your steed, plunging his axe through your neck before you can get up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons31006;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsblooddragons31007;Their numbers and the favourable terrain might have allowed the beastmen to corner you initially, but they were deadly wrong in thinking such trickery could have gotten the better of you. When the ground is soaked with their foul blood, the remaining Gors finally retreat, howling madly in fear and perhaps even shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsblooddragons31007;Disperse or perish, beasts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
