CHOSENDUEL;Chosen Duel;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHOSEN.1;The gods have heard your plea, and have answered. Following the instructions delivered in the entrails of your servant, you find yourself in a twisted grove of otherworldly trees. A hulking beast of malformed flesh and bone claws its way through to the clearing and roars a challenge to you. You're not sure if it's a former champion who succumbed to their corruption, or some unfortunate beast that was twisted by the gods, but it's definitely hostile. Defeat the creature, and gain your infamy!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHOSEN.1.b;Perhaps I will come back later?;;;;;;;;;x
VICTORY;Victory!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHOSEN.2;The beast is huge and possesses immense strength, but is slow and witless. It is a simple matter to dodge the clumsy blows and strike it repeatedly as it bellows and lurches at you.

EVTOPTCHOSEN.2.a;I am the greatest!;;;;;;;;;x
FAILURE;Failure!;;;;;;;;;x
